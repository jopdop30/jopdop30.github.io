As the coronavirus sprints towards new victims, so are people as they rush towards the toilet paper aisle at local supermarkets. No matter how hard you try to scavenge for the remains, all that you see are scratches on the shelves and shreds of the soft 5 ply paper that you desire so much. It's a rough day as you return home with nothing but a bottle of half-used sanitiser in your hands. The bathroom - once a safe and private place, now a wipeless war zone.

But hope shall continue to thrive! It is time to find an alternative to keep that bottom clean with good hygiene. And guess what? Youâ€™ve come to the right place! Here are our best substitute supplies to tidy that raw rear-end!

## Natureâ€™s Finest Leaves
Trees are still very abundant on Earth, and leaves are even more abundant than trees! Leaves can be found anywhere from your backyard, workplace, school, sports field, botanical gardens - pretty much anywhere you need them! And more importantly, they are soft, absorbent, good for the environment and they are reusable! Whatâ€™s more to love about natureâ€™s blessing to the human backside!

## Nappies

Woah, donâ€™t be too hasty there mate, just listen as this is better than it sounds. Babies use nappies so why canâ€™t adults? I mean thatâ€™s why adult diapers exist, and what a time to purchase them, plus there is no need to go to the lonely lavatory anymore. This means that we all donâ€™t have to waste time on preparing for the expected upcoming quarantine sitting on the loo! What more could you ask for in a dire situation like this?
