As the coronavirus sprints towards new victims, so are people as they rush towards the toilet paper aisle at local supermarkets. No matter how hard you try to scavenge for the remains, all that you see are scratches on the shelves and shreds of the soft 5 ply paper that you desire so much. It's a rough day as you return home with nothing but a bottle of half-used sanitiser in your hands. The bathroom - once a safe and private place, now a wipeless war zone.

But hope shall continue to thrive! It is time to find an alternative to keep that bottom clean with good hygiene. And guess what? You‚Äôve come to the right place! Here are our best substitute supplies to tidy that raw rear-end!

## Nature‚Äôs Finest Leaves
Trees are still very abundant on Earth, and leaves are even more abundant than trees! Leaves can be found anywhere from your backyard, workplace, school, sports field, botanical gardens - pretty much anywhere you need them! And more importantly, they are soft, absorbent, good for the environment and they are reusable! What‚Äôs more to love about nature‚Äôs blessing to the human backside!

## Nappies
> ‚ÄúWow, two in and the ideas are already getting absurd?‚Äù
Woah, don‚Äôt be too hasty there mate, just listen as this is better than it sounds. Babies use nappies so why can‚Äôt adults? I mean that‚Äôs why adult diapers exist, and what a time to purchase them, plus there is no need to go to the lonely lavatory anymore. This means that we all don‚Äôt have to waste time on preparing for the expected upcoming quarantine sitting on the loo! What more could you ask for in a dire situation like this?

## Tissues/Paper-Towel/Sandpaper
These are pretty much made up of the same material as toilet paper, just have a bit of a different texture. They will also not be swept off the shelves by the panicked public like current toilet rolls are meaning you will have plenty of time to snag some poo poo paper. Paper towel is the best bet since it's quite thick but has a bit of a rougher texture. Tissue paper is very thin but a tear isn‚Äôt too much of an issue as there is so much paper that‚Äôs crammed into the boxes that it will take actual effort to finish it all off. Sandpaper may be the roughest, but it will surely keep your backside the cleanest as it won‚Äôt just remove all the poo, but your skin too!

## Surgical Masks
Cheap, affordable and inexpensive. The surgical mask has it all! It keeps all nasty germs away at a low low price, so why not use it as alternative tp? All that‚Äôs being sacrificed is that you will have a slightly higher chance of getting COVID-19 in replacement for better hygiene which will help prevent you from getting COVID-19. And if you really want to, you can still wear the mask and breathe in your own waste rather than someone else‚Äôs waste from their sneezing and coughing.

## Bread
This may seem like an odd choice at first, but the more that is known about this sweet and succulent wheat product, the more obvious it becomes to why bread is on this list. Bread comes in many different shapes, sizes and flavours with all differentiating intricacies, so there will always be a different loaf of bread that will please that tail of yours. Another huge benefit is that if the crisis becomes terrible then the spread of human waste can be used as doomsday dessert!

## Water
Having showers is an essential part of human hygiene. Using water in general has been part of human hygiene for eons. And guess what? People have used water to clean their cracks long before the invention of toilet paper. There‚Äôs a reason why 70% of the Earth is made up of it.

## Steam Mop
There‚Äôs nothing more annoying than coming home from a long day of work and having to plant your arse on an ice-cold seat. That‚Äôs where the steam mop comes in to kill two birds with one stone! Not only does it replace your posterior‚Äôs precious paper but it does it one million times better with that warm and calming sensation, like as if you just dropped a bomb in a nice hot sauna.

## Vacuum Cleaner
The thought of having no paper in sight can create an awful fright, and not one with delight. That is why when the body starts to slip and slide, and you get prepared to dip and glide, an alternative plan needs to be made. That is where the vacuum cleaner comes to save the day. Suck up that waste instead of having a bottom with an ugly and unhygienic paste! No need to flush, so having to save for water bills will never be a rush.

So there you have it! Some easily accessible items that will not only save you money, but help keep that lovely rump looking spectacularly shiny! Hopefully these will save you a few tragic trips to the supermarket and will not be leaving you bare handed.
